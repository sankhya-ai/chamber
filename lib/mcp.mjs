Never send credentials or secrets.\n\nThe team shares durable memory (MEMORY.md and linked files): read it or compile context packages (context_package) before starting work; when a collaboration settles something durable (an API contract, architecture decision, ownership, convention), resolve it with coordinate_resolve to automatically update team memory with verified evidence citations. For decisions the team must stand by, use the decision tool: agents propose and review, a teammate rules, and approved decisions greet every session.
