# Chamber identity v2 (draft design — 2026-10-31, NOT implemented)

Status: DESIGN ONLY. No code yet. No publication or deployment is authorized.
Scope discipline: signed attribution is brick one; it is NOT per-member read confidentiality, and nothing here
claims it. Read confidentiality lands only with key distribution/rotation (brick three), and stays explicitly
incomplete until then.

## What the current line actually guarantees (verified in source, not assumed)

- lib/protocol.mjs: one invite secret per line -> token = HMAC(secret, "chamber/token"), line id = sha256(token)[:32],
  key = HMAC(secret, "chamber/key") AES-256-GCM. Every member holds the SAME key.
- Content+envelope binding EXISTS: bodies are sealed with (line, sender, to, id, reply_to) as AAD, and the relay
  cannot seal (it never sees the secret), so relay-side forgery or envelope/body swapping fails to open at clients.
- Sender attribution at the relay EXISTS: relay/src/index.js deliver() inserts from_agent = who.agent (the
  CONNECTED socket's claimed name), not the client frame; the names table binds name -> member (pass holder),
  first-come, one name per member, admin removal frees it.
- Personal-invite mode (ADMIN_KEY): an Ed25519-signed pass is checked at connect/member-check; revocation is a
  signed order.

## The real gaps v2 must close

1. POSSESSION: the pass is a bearer token. Anyone holding secret+pass connects AS the member and claims their
   name. There is no per-member secret at all: identity is "holds the shared secret", not "holds THEIR key".
2. MESSAGE-LEVEL PROOF: attribution is the relay's word about a live connection. A hijacked/stolen connection
   (or a relay bug) writes history as that member; nothing a member signed can be verified later, and nothing
   prevents replays of old sealed bodies (id is client-chosen; the relay dedupes only on exact id collision).
3. READ CONFIDENTIALITY: every member can open every body (shared key). The relay routes envelopes per member
   in pass mode, but that is routing policy, not cryptographic read scope. NOT closed by bricks one and two.

## v2 design (opt-in per line, versioned, no silent downgrade)

A line is created v1 (today) or v2; the version is fixed at claim time and stored by the relay. A v2 line
REJECTS legacy clients at connect (clear error: "this chamber needs chamber >= v2"), never downgrades silently.
A v1 line never pretends v2 properties.

- Brick one - member keys + enrollment: each member generates an Ed25519 keypair locally; the private key never
  leaves their machine (file 0600, NOT in the invite, NOT in any prompt/brief). A v2 invite carries the shared
  secret + an admin-signed CERTIFICATE binding member name -> their public key (the admin signs it out-of-band
  when issuing the invite; enrollment authority = the existing admin key). The relay stores member -> public key.
- Brick two - signed envelopes: every v2 message carries the member's Ed25519 signature over
  (line, from, to, id, reply_to, ts, body-hash). The relay VERIFIES the signature against the enrolled key
  before storing/forwarding (it already routes on the envelope; verification is additive). Clients verify too.
  The seal (shared line key) stays for content privacy from the relay in this brick.
- Brick three - read scope (explicitly incomplete in this design round): per-channel/per-DM keys wrapped for
  their member set with the enrolled public keys; membership change re-wraps (rotation). Until this lands, ALL
  v2 copy must say: members can still read everything on the line; v2 proves WHO said it, not WHO may read it.
- Revocation: the admin's signed removal deletes name+key enrollment; the relay rejects that key's signatures
  from that moment. Already-sealed history stays verifiable (public keys are in the enrollment record).

## Test matrix (all required before the brick is claimed)

1. Impersonation/name binding: a message signed by member A's key but claiming from B is rejected by relay AND
   by clients; a v2 client cannot claim a name enrolled to another member.
2. Replay: resending a stored (id, ts, signature) frame is rejected (id seen) ; the same body with a new id but
   an OLD ts outside the acceptance window is rejected.
3. Cross-line replay: a frame valid on line X fails verification on line Y (line id inside the signed payload).
4. Revoked credentials: after the admin's signed removal, that member's signatures are rejected at connect AND
   on send; their pass stops working; an already-connected socket is dropped.
5. Legacy downgrade: a v1 client connecting to a v2 line gets the explicit version error; a v2 client on a v1
   line runs v1 semantics and SAYS so (no v2 claims in UI/copy).
6. Enrollment authority: a certificate signed by a non-admin key is rejected; a certificate for a different
   line is rejected; the private key never appears in the invite text (string-level test) and never leaves the
   machine (no code path serializes it).
7. Key custody: invite/prompt/brief constructors carry name + certificate + public key only.

## Compatibility

Existing clients (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, DeepSeek Harness) keep working on v1 lines unchanged.
Root's Python client (server/tura_code/line, byte-compatible with protocol.mjs) needs the same v2 bricks; that
is a separate artifact in the Root repo, coordinated with the mission branch, not bundled here.
